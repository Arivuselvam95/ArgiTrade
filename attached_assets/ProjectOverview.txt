PROBLEM STATEMENT AND PROPOSED SYSTEM

3.1 INTRODUCTION

The agricultural sector in India is burdened by unpredictable crop prices, improper crop selection due to lack of regional environmental considerations, inefficient soil health monitoring, and post-harvest wastage due to poor market access. This project proposes an integrated solution combining predictive analytics, regional farming recommendations, and a digital farm commerce platform to address these challenges.

3.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT

Farmers face uncertainty regarding crop demand and selling prices, leading to confusion about profitability.

Current crop selection systems do not consider critical regional environmental parameters.

Late-stage disease detection necessitates non-organic fertilizers, harming soil health.

A significant percentage of vegetables (about 24%) are wasted annually due to inefficient farmer-buyer communication.

3.3 PROPOSED SYSTEM

The proposed solution incorporates three major modules:

Crop Price Prediction:

Collect historical crop price data.

Analyze environmental factors like weather conditions.

Use Random Forest machine learning algorithms to predict crop price, demand, and profitability.

Regional Based Crop Suggestion:

Parameters Considered:

Wind speed (collected via APIs)

Weather conditions (collected via APIs)

Temperature (collected via APIs)

Soil pH Level (entered manually after lab testing)

Soil Nutrition Level (entered manually after lab testing)

Suggest optimal crops based on these parameters.

Provide complete agricultural guidance from planning to harvest.

Farm Hub:

(a) E-Commerce for Farmers:

Farmers list available products.

Buyers, either individuals or shop owners, purchase directly from farmers.

Integrated transportation service with GPS tracking for efficient delivery.

(b) Agri-Trade Platform:

Farmers can list shares of their crops for investment after verification.

Investors can purchase shares, sharing in the business's profits and losses proportionally.

3.4 ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM

Predictable market insights for farmers.

Optimized crop selection based on real-time data.

Efficient resource utilization and smart irrigation.

Promotion of organic farming practices.

Reduction of vegetable wastage.

Creation of new investment opportunities in agriculture.

3.5 MODULES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM

MODULE 1: CROP PRICE PREDICTION

Historical market data collection.

Weather data integration.

Predictive model creation using Random Forest algorithm.

Forecast crop prices, demands, and estimated profits.

MODULE 2: REGIONAL BASED CROP SUGGESTION

Fetch wind speed, weather conditions, and temperature data from APIs.

Input soil pH and nutrition data after lab testing.

Analyze parameters and suggest suitable crops.

Provide farmers with detailed guides for crop cultivation.

MODULE 3: FARM HUB

E-Commerce for Farmers:

Direct marketplace for selling crops.

Transportation facility integrated with live tracking.

Agri-Trade:

Platform for crop share trading.

Investment and profit/loss sharing based on ownership percentage.

3.6 TECHNOLOGY STACK

Frontend: React.js (with Vite)

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Machine Learning: Python (Random Forest)

External APIs: Weather and environmental data APIs

3.7 SUMMARY

The Smart AgriTech Platform offers a multi-pronged solution for improving Indian agriculture. By leveraging machine learning, external APIs, and modern web technologies, the project aims to empower farmers with better decision-making tools, direct market access, sustainable practices, and innovative financial models. This holistic system is a step toward a sustainable and profitable agricultural future.
